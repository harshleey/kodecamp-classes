NODEJS PHILOSOPHY
1. SMALL CORE: This means that nodejs core is built with few principles and one of this principle is "having the smallest set of functionality". It leaves the rest to the user space.

The user space is the ecosystem of the module living outside of the core

2. SMALL MODULE: Nodejs uses the concept of a module as a functional means to structure the code of a program. It is the foundation of creating reusable libraries.

This principle has its root in the UNIX operating sysytem. Small is beautiful and make each program do one thing well. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is well implemented.

3. SMALL SURFACE AREA: This deals with the exposure of logic.

4. SIMPLICITY AND PRAGMATISM: Keep it simple
