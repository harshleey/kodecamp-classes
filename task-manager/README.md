# Task Manager

This is a basic task manager that will manage user's tasks. It will perform CRUD operations like `create`, `edit`, `list`, and `delete`.

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

| functions |         operations          |
| :-------: | :-------------------------: |
| `create`  |   this creates a new task   |
|  `edit`   | this edits an existing task |
