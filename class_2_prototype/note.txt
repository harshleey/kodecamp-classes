PROTOTYPAL INHERITANCE
This is a type of inheritance mechanism in javascript where objects can inherit properties and methods directly from other objects.

Objects are created by reference and not by value

What distinguishes a constructor from other functions is that the name starts with a capital letter

There are data properties and accessor properties

prototypes with constructors is simply combining constructors with prototypes and adding methods and data types. How you modify your object and want them to behave.


FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
This is a programming paradigm that emphasizes writing programs using pure functions and avoiding mutable data and side effects.

* Pure functions: Do not change the initial data
* Immutability: Copy a value and make changes to it
* Higher-order functions
* Recursion
